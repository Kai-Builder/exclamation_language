# Include VS Pre_include
The Include Syntax, `!.INCLUDE`, Is a way to Import File Exports with the ExclamationExporter.

On the Other Hand, `!pre_include`, Is a Targeted Function Which adds RCP and Umbrella to something Exclamation calls an ExportList.

Example

```
!pre_include rcp
!pre_include umbrella

!.INCLUDE foobar.exclaport
```
