# Using Default Keywords

The `for` And `keep` keywords are mostly storage-based Functional KeyWords based off of R#'s Keep main function.

Exclamation is a Pre-Compiled Language And Requires you to Add it to PATH For Global Uses.

The Exclamation Module Handler Is Inside of the Compiler. 2 Modules Come Pre-Packaged, You must install every other module manually,

Modules are published to the Website Coming in Exclamation 1.9. There are also ways to install them manually, But i'd rather you install from the website which are safer.

# .INCLUDE

.Include is the simple and very safe way to include any external export scripts that begin with .exclaexport

Includes Are able to have Paths. Here are the syntaxes.

```
// Include Path
!.INCLUDE Foo\Bar
```

# $stdin

StdIN Is a Library That has all of the input streams available to ExclamationScript.

Most Pre-Defined Definitions Or Functions (!), Usually are in a class named **io**.

## What is IO?

IO Stands for Input-Output and contains The Following Children.

- warn
- print (!print)
- re_size
- alias?

### Warn

Warn is a function that allows the user To Warn Consumers of a certain function (Usually Deprecated Ones), By Giving a Message.

### print or !print

Print Prints the Line After the KeyWord Is called. Classic!
